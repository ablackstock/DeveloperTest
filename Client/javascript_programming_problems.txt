JavaScript Programming Problems
===============================

These problems should be done in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  Use any 3rd-party
libraries you want.  Use the text editor of your choice.

1. FizzBuzz

    - Write a web page that displays the numbers from 1 to 100...
    - But for multiples of 3, display "Fizz" instead of the number
    - For multiples of 5, display "Buzz" instead of the number
    - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, display "FizzBuzz"

3. TODO List

    - Write a web page that allows the user to work with a basic TODO list
    - The page should allow the user to type in a TODO list item and add it to
      a list of items displayed on the page
    - The page should allow the user to remove individual TODO list items
    - The page should provide the ability to clear the entire list at once

4. CSS

    - Create an HTML page with 3 divs - each containing some filler text (e.g.
      "lorem ipsum..." etc.)
    - One div should float left and occupy about half the page width and should
      have a blue background color
    - Another div should float right and occupy about half the page width and
      should have an orange background color
    - The last div should sit below the other divs, fill about the full width
      of the screen and should have a gray background color
